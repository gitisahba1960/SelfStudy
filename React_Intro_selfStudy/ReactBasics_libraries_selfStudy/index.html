now with React you can easily manipulate the DOM under the hood (declarative)
with ReactDOM you show the result (render) in browser

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
    <!--React library-->
    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js"
    ></script>
    <!--ReactDOM library-->
    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.development.js"
    ></script>
    <script defer src="main.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="nativeDOM"></div>
