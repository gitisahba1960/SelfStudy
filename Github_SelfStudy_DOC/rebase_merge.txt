Both of these commands are designed to integrate changes from one branch into another branch—they just do it in very different ways.

merge:
1- git checkout feature
git merge main
or 2 - git merge feature main

Merging is a non-destructive operation

rebase:
1- git checkout feature
git rebase main


rebase is a destructive operation! be careful when someone else is also working on a project 
rebase re-write the project history by creat brand new commits
(but easier to track the changes than merge) when git log!! it eliminates the unnecessary merge commits required by git merge  you get a much cleaner project history.
